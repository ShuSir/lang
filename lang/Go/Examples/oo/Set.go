Go 101, the SET data structure
// https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/golang-nuts/NvwxAJgD3KI

What the Go's way for the SET data structure? Like the list in Perl that
offers FIFO/Stack operation and delete from random places.

+1 to using a map. "container" is usually not what you want.

Technically, the spec isn't 100% clear here, either. It says that each
entry will be produced "at most once". This implies that newly added
entries might never be produced. That'd still be covered by "at least
once". And in this case, OP expects them to be produced.

   The behaviour is not deterministic, despite what the spec says.
   There are at least two results I've witnessed:

Go correctly defines the behaviour of range loops when you mutate the
collection. In particular, the very common pattern of deleting the key
you are currently sitting on, is well-defined, deterministic and
usually what you want.

Notably, the following pattern will work for a recursive visitor:

for len(set) > 0 {
  for item := range set {
     do(item)
     add some elements to set
     delete(item)
  }
}
