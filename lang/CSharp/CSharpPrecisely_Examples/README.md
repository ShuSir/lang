File examples/README * Last update 2011-08-05

Examples from 

  Peter Sestoft and Henrik I. Hansen: 
  C# Precisely, Second edition. The MIT Press 2012. ISBN 978-0-262-51686-0.

These files are from http://www.itu.dk/people/sestoft/csharpprecisely/

The source code for Example 1 is in file Example001.cs, and so on.

Some example files are identical, because the same example is used to
illustrate several points in the book.

Most example files are compiled and ready to run; running them
requires Microsoft .Net version 4.0 (Visual Studio 2010) or 5.0, or a
similar runtime from the Mono project.

For instance, to run the program from Example 1, unpack the example
archive and type

   Example001 7 9 13

on the command line.

Those programs that require additional command line arguments will say
so if invoked without command line arguments.

NOTICE: The book C# Precisely and its example programs come with no

the authors or the IT University of Copenhagen or The MIT Press be
